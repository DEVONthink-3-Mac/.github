It provides a structured and searchable environment to store, organize, and analyze all types of data — from PDFs and documents to web clippings, notes, and email archives.  

The app uses an advanced AI-powered system to automatically categorize, tag, and relate your information. This means you can focus on your work while DEVONthink handles the heavy lifting of organizing and connecting your knowledge.
